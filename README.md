# Module-1-Assignment
Write a Medium post describing an exploratory analysis of a question for which 1) you have some expertise, and 2) you can describe who needs the answer to this question, and 3) you can explain how this answer enables a particular decision. This assignment will serve as a baseline for your work in this course, and at the end of the semester, you can review it so evaluate whether you would do things differently.

Your post should include the following:

Describe a question you think can be answered from data, what specific stakeholder is asking this question, and what decision(s) the answer to this question will inform.
Describe the data that could answer this question, what fields it contains, and why it is relevant to your question.
Explain how you collected some subset of this data (e.g., libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, tweepy, praw, etc. or from data archive). 
Perform an exploratory data analysis that helps answer the question you posed. 
Describe how you cleaned up this data, common bugs you think others might encounter, and how you fixed them, etc.
Include figures or tables summarizing your findings. 
Discuss the limitations of your analysis. Whatâ€™s missing? How might it be biased?
Include a link to one of your GitHub repositories that contains the code you have developed for this assignment.
When you have written your post, publish it via Medium, add your post it to the class publication via Medium, and submit the URL to it via ELMS.

Note: The publication name for the class is "Data Science Techniques [INST414] Links to an external site."
